The OT validation function takes in a stale file (.txt), a latest file (.txt), and an operations (.json) JSON file. 

The function validates whether the operations applied to the stale file result in the latest file. 

To run the program: 
python main.py [STALE_FILE] [LATEST FILE] [OPERATIONS FILE]

For help, paste into the shell : 
python main.py -h
